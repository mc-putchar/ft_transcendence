1. Choose a Networking Library
Select a networking library or framework (e.g., socket, WebSocket, Pygame-Net, or higher-level frameworks like Flask with Socket.IO).

2. Server Setup
Create a Server: Write a server script to handle game state, player connections, and data transmission.
Game Logic on Server: Move most of the game logic (like ball movement, score calculation, etc.) to the server to ensure consistency across clients.
Handle Player Inputs: Server receives player inputs (like paddle movements) and updates the game state.

3. Client Setup
Create Clients: Modify your game to act as a client that connects to the server.
Sync with Server: The client sends player input to the server and receives game state updates (like ball position and scores) from the server.
Rendering: Clients handle only rendering and input collection.

4. Synchronizing Game State
Periodic Updates: Clients receive frequent updates from the server to keep the game state in sync.
Lag Compensation: Implement techniques to handle network latency, like client-side prediction and server reconciliation.

5. Handling Disconnections
Reconnection Logic: Allow players to reconnect if they get disconnected.
Graceful Handling: Manage scenarios where players leave the game mid-session.

6. Testing
Local Testing: Test the game on a local network to ensure that all four players can connect and play smoothly.
Online Testing: If going online, test with different network conditions to ensure stability.

7. Deployment
Host Server: Deploy the server on a cloud service or a dedicated machine for online play.
Distribute Clients: Ensure players have the necessary client software to connect to your server.
